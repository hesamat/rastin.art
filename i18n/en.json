In addition, for two years he became acquainted with the majlesi (gathering) repertoires of the Tanbur under Master Moradi.\n\nIn the vocal field he learned the old vocal Radif from Master Hatam Asgari Farahani and obtained his written endorsement, and absorbed vocal subtleties from Amir Sheikholeslam and Rambod Sadaif.\n\nHis professional activities are wide-ranging. As a researcher he has compiled and organized the works of Darvish Khan and notated a portion of Master Rambod Sadaif's vocal Radif. He participated in efforts connected with the inscription of the National Iranian Radif at UNESCO. Other experience includes three years of collaboration with Radio Farhang (Culture Radio) producing and performing for the weekly program “Dar Mahzare Ostād” (In the Presence of the Master), directing a music center within a cultural organization of Tehran Municipality, and organizing numerous scholarly gatherings.\n\nRastinfar completed an advanced Setar-making course at the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts and, after obtaining the required license, founded his own instrument workshop.\n\nAs a composer, instrumentalist and vocalist he has appeared in numerous concerts inside and outside Iran and performed in albums including “Dar Masir-e Faslha” (In the Path of Seasons), “Gomgashteh” (The Lost), “Hekayat-e Eshq” (Tale of Love) and “Shab o Khamooshi” (Night and Silence).\n\nTo advance educational and artistic aims he established the “Nagmeh Homayoun Rastin” Cultural & Artistic Institute and the separate “Rastinfar Music Academy”. He teaches at reputable music schools. His method is structured through categorized files of the instrumental and vocal Radif across beginner, intermediate and advanced levels, integrating tasnifs, rengs and chaharmezrabs. In class he emphasizes authentic content and the living spirit of the Radif, analytical comparison of instrumental and vocal pathways, shared tetrachords (dangs), and acquaints students with the history and philosophy of Iranian music.",
